# CSCE574 Robotics

I am not registered for the class. Thr professor is kind enough to allow me to sit in the classroom to learn the fundamentals of robotics. If you are in the class and you happen to find this repository, please DO NOT copy my code for your assignments. I won't be responsible for any consequences you might get by using my code.

For your reference, I also found this github respository:
